## üåç Principles

At Flight-Academy UK, we are driven by a set of core principles that guide our work and our contributions to the flight school and open-source communities:

- Creating an Outstanding Service: Our primary goal is to deliver high-quality, reliable software that meets the needs of flight schools and enhances the flight training experience. We‚Äôre committed to continuous improvement and always welcome feedback to make our platform even better.
- Transparency: We believe in transparency, both in how we work and how our software operates. Our code is open-source, allowing users to understand, review, and contribute to our platform. Transparency fosters trust and collaboration, which we believe are essential for long-term success.
- Freedom and Open Source: We believe in promoting user freedom by making our platform available under GPL licenses. This allows users to not only use our software but also to study, modify, and distribute it according to their needs. Open-source licensing aligns with our commitment to a collaborative, community-driven approach to software development.

These principles help us ensure that our platform is not only effective and secure but also aligns with the values of the global open-source and flight training communities.
